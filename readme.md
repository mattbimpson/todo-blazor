# Todo - Blazor
A todo app made with Blazor.
Blazor allows you to write your UIs in C#, with the Razor view engine.
This app runs in Web Assembly mode - allowing your .net code to run within the browser. 

I have used the Blazored.LocalStorage nuget package to persist changes within the browser.

# To run, make sure you have the dotnet core 3.1 sdk installed

Use dotnet build / dotnet run
